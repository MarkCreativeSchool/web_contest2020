      <p class="context">In 1774, a series of laws called the Coercive (Intolerable) Act was passed on by the British Parliament to punish Massachusetts after the Boston Tea Party. As a response to Britainâ€™s sanctions, Pennsylvania called for a continental congress that resolved to refuse trade with Britain. This caused even more conflict between Britain and the colonies. </p>
