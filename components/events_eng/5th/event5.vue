          <h6 class="double-title"><b>End of World War 1 (1918 November)</b></h6>
          <p class="double-context">The Paris Peace Conference started on 1919, January 18, and ended on June 28th when the Treaty of Versailles was signed at the Palace of Versailles.
The representatives of the Allied Powers, including Japan, participated in the meeting, but the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States took the initiative. Germany, the defeated country, could not participate, as well as the Russian and Soviet governments since these two countries had just gone through a revolution.  World War I ended as a victory on the side of the Allied Powers (co-operating countries), but had a great impact beyond the victorious and defeated countries.
