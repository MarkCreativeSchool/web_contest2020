    <h3 class="start">Arrest/Shooting Rates and Racism</h3>
    <p class="two">
        It has been investigated that the fatal shooting rate by police is disportionate based on race. Though the percentage for the overall fatal shootings of Black Americans are approximately 26% (1345 out of 5109 people) in 2020, it is disproportionate whilst taking the population of Black Americans in regard. Black Americans take up approximately 12~15% of the American population, which indicates the disproportionate rate of shooting kills though 50% of those that were shot by the police were white. It is shown on the graph that 30% per million of Black Americans are shot, a significant amount compared to 12% per million for White Americans. This signifies that if the population were to be the same for both Black and White Americans, there will be a 18% difference in fatal police shootings.

    <p class="two">
    Another investigation reports that though the marujuana usage between black and white people over 12 are nearly the same, white being 16.5% and blacks being 17.8%, it was reported that the arrest rates per 100k in the US is 3 times more for black people than it is for white people, shown and comprared in the two graphs above. This could suggest that the police have a tendency to discriminate against certain races among others, causing the disparity in the arrest rates even though the usage rate is nearly the same.
